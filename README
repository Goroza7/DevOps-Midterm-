This project is a simple web application built using Flask that allows users to post messages via a form. Submitted messages are dynamically displayed below the form, functioning as a basic message board.

Project includes:

- A dynamic route to handle message submissions.
- Unit tests to verify route functionality.
- GitHub version control, with main and dev branches
- A CI pipeline with GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on push or pull requests
- Ansible for setup automation
- Simulated Blue-Green Deployment,
- Basic Monitoring (health_check, manual rollback and automated rollback if health_check fails)

## In order to Run just Local application

```bash
ansible-playbook build.yml
python3 run.py
pytest # for tests
```

## Simulating Blue-Green Deployment

```bash
ansible-playbook build.yml
ansible-playbook deploy.yml
# First it will create blue on C:/Midterm(DevOps) production folder with only blue, for green rerun the deploy.yml,
# you can also see on localport 5000 which envrionment it is currently running on.

# If you want to manually rollback run
ansible-playbook rollback.yml

# In order to check its health run
ansible-playbook health_check.yml # logs will be saved in deployment.log(it will be also copied into appropriate production folder, you can also see logs on /status page)

# In order to kill the running application
ansible-playbook kill_app.yml

# And finally if you want to rollback automatically run
ansible-playbook health_check.yml # app should be killed for this otherwise it will just save health log into log file.
```
