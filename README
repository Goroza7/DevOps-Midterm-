A basic web application with:

- Flask web server
- GitHub version control
- GitHub Actions for CI
- Ansible for setup automation
- Simulated Blue-Green Deployment
- Basic Monitoring via shell script(health_check, manual rollback and automated rollback if health_check fails)

## In order to Run just Local application

```bash
ansible-playbook build.yml
python3 run.py
```

## Simulating Blue-Green Deployment

```bash
ansible-playbook build.yml
ansible-playbook deploy.yml
# First it will create blue on C:/Midterm(DevOps) production folder with only blue, for green rerun the deploy.yml,
# you can also see on localport 5000 which envrionment it is currently running on.

# If you want to manually rollback run
ansible-playbook rollback.yml

# In order to check its health run
ansible-playbook health_check.yml # logs will be saved in deployment.log(it will be also copied into appropriate production folder, you can also see logs on /status page)

# In order to kill the running application run
ansible-playbook kill_app.yml

# And finally if you want to rollback automatically run
ansible-playbook health_check.yml
```
